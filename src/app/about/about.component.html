<h2>Our motto is dream big, pay later</h2>
<hr>
<p>Everyone has dreams, whether it is a dream as simple as fixing your car for your daily commute, or a dream as grand as making a music video for Puff Daddy. We at DreamCom are here to help you with those dreams. And for those of you who don't dream, maybe you have money. If you have money you can help with other peoples dreams and that's what this site is all about. Connecting people with dreams to people with money is our goal, and so far we've done a heck of a job acheiving it. Just one dollar to someone's dream today, can make a lifetime of happiness and success for a better tommorow. Money + Dreams = Success, it's that simple. Go out and acheive your dreams, and if you don't dream, pay for other people's dreams, because that's all you gotta do.</p>
